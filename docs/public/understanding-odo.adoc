= Understanding `odo`

`odo` is a CLI tool for creating applications on OpenShift and Kubernetes. `odo` allows developers to concentrate on creating applications without the need to administer a cluster itself.
Creating deployment configurations, build configurations, service routes and other OpenShift or Kubernetes elements are all automated by `odo`.

Existing tools such as `oc` are more operations-focused and require a deep understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. `odo` abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts allowing developers to focus on what is most important to them: code.

[id="odo-key-features"]
== Key features

`odo` is designed to be simple and concise with the following key features:

* Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to developers, such as projects, applications, and components.
* Completely client based. No additional server other than OpenShift is required for deployment.
* Official support for Node.js and Java components.
* Detects changes to local code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real time.
* Lists all the available components and services from the cluster.

== Core concepts

Project::
A project is your source code, tests, and libraries organized in a separate single unit.
Application::
An application is a program designed for end users. An application consists of multiple microservices or components that work individually to build the entire application.
Examples of applications: a video game, a media player, a web browser.
Component::
A component is a set of Kubernetes resources which host code or data. Each component can be run and deployed separately.
Examples of components: Node.js, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.
Service::
A service is software that your component links to or depends on.
Examples of services: MariaDB, Jenkins, MySQL.
Devfile::
A portable file responsible for your entire reproducable development environment.
