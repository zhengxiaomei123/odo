== Setting up

Requires *Go 1.13*

Testing and release builds happen with the above version. Developers are advised to stick to this version if they can but it is not compulsory.


[WARNING]
====
If you are adding any features that require a higher version of golang, than the one mentioned above, please contact the maintainers in order to check if the releasing systems can handle the newer version. If that is ok, please ensure you update the required golang version, both here and in the files below, in your PR.

.List of files to update for golang version
 * link:/scripts/rpm-prepare.sh[`scripts/rpm-prepare.sh`]
 * link:/.travis.yml[`.travis.yml`]
 * link:/Dockerfile.rhel[`Dockerfile.rhel`]
 * link:/openshift-ci/build-root/Dockerfile[`openshift-ci/build-root/Dockerfile`]
====

First setup your fork of the odo project, following the steps below

 . link:https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo[Fork] the link:https://github.com/openshift/odo[`odo`] repository.

 . Clone your fork:
+
NOTE: The following commands assume that you have the `$GOPATH` environment variable properly set. We highly recommend you place `odo` code into the $GOPATH.
+

----
$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/odo.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift/odo
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift/odo
$ git remote add upstream 'https://github.com/openshift/odo'
----
+
When cloning `odo`, the Windows terminal such as PowerShell or CMD may throw a *Filename too long* error. To avoid such an error, set your Git configuration as follows:
+
----
$ git config --system core.longpaths true
----

 . Install tools used by the build and test system:
+
----
$ make goget-tools
----

== Submitting a pull request(PR)

 . Create a branch, refer to the guidelines below in the sections below, and create a PR with your changes. If your PR is still in-progress, indicate this with a label or add WIP in your PR title.
+
A PR must include:

 * Descriptive context that outlines what has been changed and why
 * A link to the active or open issue it fixes (if applicable)
 * (OPTIONAL) A "signed-off" signature is good practice. You may sign your commit using `git commit -s` or `git commit --amend --no-edit -s` to a previously created commit

== Useful make targets

bin:: (default) `go build` the executable in cmd/odo
install:: build and install `odo` in your GOPATH
validate:: run gofmt, go vet and other validity checks
goget-tools:: download tools used to build & test
test:: run all unit tests - same as `go test pkg/...`
test-integration:: run all integration tests
test-coverage:: generate test coverage report

Read the Makefile itself for more information.


== Reviewing a PR

=== PR review process

. Once you submit a PR, the @openshift-ci-robot automatically requests two reviews from reviewers and suggests an approver based on `OWNERS` files.
. Each PR requires *one* code review (lgtm label) and *one* approve (approved label).
. After a code reviewer is satisfied with the changes he adds `/lgtm` (looks good to me) as a comment to the PR. Which applies the *lgtm* label.
. The approver reviews the PR and if satisfied, adds `/approve` as a comment to the PR. Which applies the *approve* label.
* After the PR has *lgtm* and *approve* labels and the required tests pass, the bot automatically merges the PR.
+
NOTE: If you are a maintainer and have write access to the `odo` repository, modify your git configuration so that you do not accidentally push to upstream:
+
----
$ git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
----

=== What to look out for when reviewing a pull request:

* Have tests been added?
* Does the feature or fix work locally?
* Is the code understandable, have comments been added to the code?
* A PR should pass all the pre-submit tests, all request changes must be resolved, and needs at least two approving reviews. If you apply the `/lgtm` label before it meets this criteria, put it on hold with the `/hold` label immediately. You can use `/lgtm cancel` to cancel your `/lgtm` and use `/hold cancel` once you are ready to approve it. This especially applies to draft PRs.
* Approvers can use `/approve` and `/approve cancel` to approve or hold their approval respectively.

=== About Prow
`odo` uses the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow[Prow] infrastucture for CI testing.

* It uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/owners.md[OWNERS] files to determine who can approve and lgtm a PR.
* Prow has two levels of OWNERS, *Approvers* and *Reviewers*
** *Approvers* look for holistic acceptance criteria, including
dependencies with other features, forward and backward compatibility, API and flag definitions, etc. In essence, the high levels of design
** *Reviewers* look for general code quality, correctness, sane software engineering, style, etc. In essence, the quality of the actual code itself.

* Avoid merging the PR manually (unless it is an emergency and  you have the required permissions). Prowâ€™s tide component automatically merges the PR once all the conditions are met.
It also ensures that post-submit tests (tests that run before merge) validate the PR.
* Use the link:https://deck-ci.svc.ci.openshift.org/command-help[command-help] to see the list of possible bot commands.

== Tests

We use unit, integration and e2e (End to end) tests.

=== Unit tests

Unit tests for `odo` functions are written using package
https://godoc.org/k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes/fake[fake]. This allows us to create a fake client, and then mock the API calls defined under link:https://github.com/openshift/client-go[OpenShift client-go] and link:https://godoc.org/k8s.io/client-go[k8s client-go].

The tests are written in golang using the https://golang.org/pkg/testing/[pkg/testing] package.

==== Writing unit tests using the fake Kubernetes client

. Identify the APIs used by the function to be tested.
. Initialize the fake client along with the relevant client sets.
The following example explains the initialization of fake clients and the creation of fake objects.
+
The function `GetImageStreams` in https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/master/pkg/occlient/occlient.go[`pkg/occlient.go`] fetches imagestream objects through the API:
+
[source,go]
----
func (c *Client) GetImageStreams(namespace string) ([]imagev1.ImageStream, error) {
        imageStreamList, err := c.imageClient.ImageStreams(namespace).List(metav1.ListOptions{})
        if err != nil {
                return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "unable to list imagestreams")
        }
        return imageStreamList.Items, nil
}
----

 .. For writing the tests, start by initializing the fake client using the function `FakeNew()` which initializes the image clientset harnessed by `GetImageStreams` function:
+
[source,go]
----
client, fkclientset := FakeNew()
----
.. In the `GetImageStreams` functions, the list of imagestreams is fetched through the API. While using fake client, this list can be emulated using a https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/testing/fake.go[`PrependReactor`] interface:
+
[source,go]
----
 fkclientset.ImageClientset.PrependReactor("list", "imagestreams", func(action ktesting.Action) (bool, runtime.Object, error) {
         return true, fakeImageStreams(tt.args.name, tt.args.namespace), nil
     })
----
+
The `PrependReactor` expects `resource` and `verb` to be passed in as arguments. Get this information by looking at the link:https://github.com/openshift/client-go/blob/master/image/clientset/versioned/typed/image/v1/fake/fake_imagestream.go[`List` function for fake imagestream]:
+
[source,go]
----
func (c *FakeImageStreams) List(opts v1.ListOptions) (result *image_v1.ImageStreamList, err error) {
        obj, err := c.Fake.Invokes(testing.NewListAction(imagestreamsResource, imagestreamsKind, c.ns, opts), &image_v1.ImageStreamList{})
    ...
}
 func NewListAction(resource schema.GroupVersionResource, kind schema.GroupVersionKind, namespace string, opts interface{}) ListActionImpl {
        action := ListActionImpl{}
        action.Verb = "list"
        action.Resource = resource
        action.Kind = kind
        action.Namespace = namespace
        labelSelector, fieldSelector, _ := ExtractFromListOptions(opts)
        action.ListRestrictions = ListRestrictions{labelSelector, fieldSelector}
         return action
}
----
+
The `List` function internally calls `NewListAction` defined in link:https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/blob/master/testing/actions.go[`k8s.io/client-go/testing/actions.go`].
From these functions, we see that the `resource` and `verb` to be passed into the `PrependReactor` interface are `imagestreams` and `list` respectively.
+
You can see the entire test function `TestGetImageStream` in link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/master/pkg/occlient/occlient_test.go[`pkg/occlient/occlient_test.go`].
+
NOTE: You can use environment variable `CUSTOM_HOMEDIR` to specify a custom home directory. It can be used in environments where a user and home directory are not resolvable.

. In the case where functions fetch or create new objects through the APIs, add a https://godoc.org/k8s.io/client-go/testing#Fake.AddReactor[reactor] interface returning fake objects.
. Verify the objects returned.

NOTE: Refer https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/LearnTesting for Go best practices on unit testing.

=== Integration and e2e tests

*Prerequisites for OpenShift cluster:*

* A `minishift` or OpenShift 3.11 environment with Service Catalog enabled:
+
----
$ MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=y minishift start --extra-clusterup-flags "--enable=*,service-catalog,automation-service-broker,template-service-broker"
----
OR
* A `crc` environment for 4.* local cluster:
+
Follow link:https://github.com/code-ready/crc#documentation[`crc`] installation guide.
+
OR
* A 4.* cluster hosted remotely

*Prerequisites for Kubernetes cluster:*

* A `kubernetes` environment set up with single node cluster:
+
For a single node `kubernetes` cluster install link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/[`Minikube`]

NOTE: Make sure that `odo` and `oc` binaries are in `$PATH`. Use the cloned odo directory to launch tests on 3.11 and 4.* clusters. To communicate with `Kubernetes` cluster use `kubectl`. No cluster configuration is needed to run tests on a 3.11 cluster spun up by `Minishift` or `oc cluster up` locally. However a 4.* cluster needs to be configured before launching the tests against it. The files `kubeadmin-password` and `kubeconfig` which contain cluster login details should be present in the `auth` directory and it should reside in the same directory as `Makefile`. If it is not present in the auth directory, please create it. Then run `make configure-installer-tests-cluster` to configure the 4.* cluster.

*Integration tests:*

Integration tests utilize link:https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo[`Ginkgo`] and its preferred matcher library link:https://github.com/onsi/gomega[`Gomega`] which define sets of test cases (spec). As per ginkgo test file comprises specs and these test file are controlled by test suite. 

Test and test suite files are located in `tests/integration` directory and can be called using `make test-integration`. 

To run ONE individual test, you can either:

* Supply the name via command-line: `ginkgo -focus="When executing catalog list without component directory" tests/integration/`
* Modify the `It` statement to `Fit` and run `ginkgo tests/integration/`

Integration tests validate and focus on specific fields of odo functionality or individual commands. For example, `cmd_app_test.go` or `generic_test.go`.

*E2e tests:*

E2e (End to end) uses the same library as integration test. E2e tests and test suite files are located in `tests/e2escenarios` directory and can be called using `.PHONY` within `makefile`. Basically end to end (e2e) test contains user specific scenario that is combination of some features/commands in a single test file.

*How to write:*

Refer to the odo clean test link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/master/tests/template/template_cleantest_test.go[`template`].

*Test guidelines:*

Please follow certain protocol before contributing to odo tests. This helps in how to contribute in link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/tree/master/tests[`odo tests`].

* Before writing tests (Integration/e2e) scenario make sure that the test scenario (Integration or e2e) is identified properly.
+

----
For example:
In storage feature test, storage command will be tested properly includes positive, negative and corner cases whereas in e2e scenario only one or two storage command will be tested in e2e scenario like `create component -> link -> add storage -> certain operation -> delete storage -> unlink -> delete component`.
----
+

* Create a new test file for a new feature and make sure that the feature file name should add proper sense. If the feature test file is already present then update the same test file with new scenario.
+

----
For example:
For storage feature, a new storage test file is created. If new functionality is added to the storage feature then same file will be updated with new scenario. Naming of the test file should follow a common format like `cmd_<feature name>_test`. So the storage feature test file name will be `cmd_storage_test.go`. Same naming convention can be used for e2e test like `e2e_<release name>_test` or `e2e_<full scenario name>_test`.
----
+

* Test description should make sense of what it implements in the specs. Use proper test description in `Describe` block
+

----
For example:
For storage feature, the appropriate test description would be `odo storage command tests`.

var _ = Describe("odo storage command tests", func() {
    [...]
})
----
+

* For a better understanding of what a spec does, use proper description in `Context` and `it` block
+

----
For example:
Context("when running help for storage command", func() {
	It("should display the help", func() {
		[...]
	})
})
----
+

* Due to parallel test run support make sure that the should run in isolation, otherwise the test result will lead to race condition. To achieve this ginkgo provides some in build functions `BeforeEach`, `AfterEach` etc.
+

----
For example:
var _ = Describe("odo generic", func() {
    var project string
	var context string
	var oc helper.OcRunner
    BeforeEach(func() {
	    oc = helper.NewOcRunner("oc")
	    SetDefaultEventuallyTimeout(10 * time.Minute)
	    context = helper.CreateNewContext()
    })
    AfterEach(func() {
	    os.RemoveAll(context)
    })
    Context("deploying a component with a specific image name", func() {
        JustBeforeEach(func() {
            os.Setenv("GLOBALODOCONFIG", filepath.Join(context, "config.yaml"))
            project = helper.CreateRandProject()
        })

        JustAfterEach(func() {
            helper.DeleteProject(project)
            os.Unsetenv("GLOBALODOCONFIG")
        })
        It("should deploy the component", func() {
            helper.CmdShouldPass("git", "clone", "https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex", context+"/nodejs-ex")
            helper.CmdShouldPass("odo", "create", "nodejs:latest", "testversioncmp", "--project", project, "--context", context+"/nodejs-ex")
            helper.CmdShouldPass("odo", "push", "--context", context+"/nodejs-ex")
            helper.CmdShouldPass("odo", "delete", "-f", "--context", context+"/nodejs-ex")
        })
    })
})
----
+

* Donâ€™t create new test file for issues(bug) and try to add some scenario for each bug fix if applicable
+

* Donâ€™t use unnecessary text validation in `Expect` of certain command output. Only validation of key text specific to that scenario would be enough.
+

----
For example:
While running multiple push on same component without changing any source file.

helper.CmdShouldPass("odo", "push", "--show-log", "--context", context+"/nodejs-ex")
output := helper.CmdShouldPass("odo", "push", "--show-log", "--context", context+"/nodejs-ex")
Expect(output).To(ContainSubstring("No file changes detected, skipping build"))
----
+

* If oc, odo or generic library you are looking for is not present in helper package then create a new library function as per the scenario requirement.
+

* The test spec should run in parallel (Default) or sequentially as per choice. Check test template for reference.
+

* Run tests on local env before pushing PRs

*Test variables:*

There are some test environment variable that helps to get more control over the test run and it's results

* TEST_EXEC_NODES: Env variable TEST_EXEC_NODES is used to pass spec execution type (parallel or sequential) for ginkgo tests. To run the specs sequentially use TEST_EXEC_NODES=1, otherwise by default the specs are run in parallel on 2 ginkgo test node. Any TEST_EXEC_NODES value greater than one runs the spec in parallel on the same number of ginkgo test nodes.

* SLOW_SPEC_THRESHOLD: Env variable SLOW_SPEC_THRESHOLD is used for ginkgo tests. After this time (in second), ginkgo marks test as slow. The default value is set to 120s.

* GINKGO_TEST_ARGS: Env variable GINKGO_TEST_ARGS is used to get control over enabling test flags against each test target run. For example, To enable verbosity export or set env GINKGO_TEST_ARGS like `GINKGO_TEST_ARGS=-v`.

* UNIT_TEST_ARGS: Env variable UNIT_TEST_ARGS is used to get control over enabling test flags along with go test. For example, To enable verbosity export or set env UNIT_TEST_ARGS like `UNIT_TEST_ARGS=-v`.

*Running integration tests on Openshift:*

For running tests on a 3.11 cluster, login to the cluster using the required credentials. For example `odo login -u <user_name> -p <password> <server_URL>`. In case of 4.* cluster, `make configure-installer-tests-cluster` performs the login operation required to run the test. By default, the tests are run against the `odo` binary placed in the $PATH which is created by the command `make`. Integration tests can be run in two ways, parallel and sequential. To control the parallel run, use the environment variable `TEST_EXEC_NODES`. For example, the component test can be run as following:

* To run the test in parallel, on a test cluster (By default the test will run in parallel on two ginkgo test node):

+
Run component command integration tests
+
----
$ make test-cmp-e2e
----
+

* To run the component command integration tests sequentially or on single ginkgo test node:
+
Run component command integration tests
+
----
$ TEST_EXEC_NODES=1 make test-cmd-cmp
----

NOTE: To see the number of available integration test file for validation, press `tab` just after writing `make test-cmd-`. However there is a test file `generic_test.go` which handles certain test specs easily and we can run it parallelly by calling `make test-generic`. By calling `make test-integration`, the whole suite will run all the specs in parallel on two ginkgo test node except `service` and `link` irrespective of service catalog status in the cluster. However `make test-integration-service-catalog` runs all specs of service and link tests in parallel on a cluster having service catalog enabled. `make test-odo-login-e2e` doesn't honour environment variable `TEST_EXEC_NODES`. So by default it runs login and logout command integration test suites on a single ginkgo test node sequentially to avoid race conditions during a parallel run.

*Running integration tests on Kubernetes:*

By default, the link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/tree/master/tests/integration/devfile[`integration tests`] for devfile feature, which is in experimental mode, run against `kubernetes` cluster. For more information on Experimental mode, please read link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/master/docs/dev/experimental-mode.adoc:[`odo experimental mode`] document.

The tests are run against the `odo` binary placed in the PATH which is created by the command `make`. Integration tests can be run in two ways (parallel and sequential). To control the parallel run use environment variable `TEST_EXEC_NODES`. For example, the devfile tests can be run

* To run the tests on Kubernetes cluster:

+
Set the `KUBERNETES` environment variable
+
----
$ export KUBERNETES=true
----

+
Enable the experimental mode
+
----
$ export ODO_EXPERIMENTAL=true
----
+
OR
+
----
$ odo preference set Experimental true -f
----

* To run the test in parallel, on a test cluster (By default the test will run in parallel on two ginkgo test node):

+
Run catalog command integration tests
+
----
$ make test-cmd-devfile-catalog
----
+

* To run the catalog command integration tests sequentially or on single ginkgo test node:
+
Run catalog command integration tests
+
----
$ TEST_EXEC_NODES=1 make test-cmd-devfile-catalog
----

NOTE: To see the number of available integration test files for validation, press `tab` keb just after writing `make test-cmd-devfile-`. By calling `make test-integration-devfile`, the suite will run all test specs in parallel on two ginkgo test nodes.

*Running e2e tests:*

(E2e) End to end test run behaves in the similar way like integration test does. To see the number of available e2e test file for execution, press tab just after writing `make test-e2e-`. For e2e suite level execution of all e2e test spec use `make test-e2e-all`. For example

* To run the java e2e test in parallel, on a test cluster (By default the component test will run in parallel on two ginkgo test node):
+
----
$ make test-e2e-java
----
+

* To run the java e2e test sequentially or on single ginkgo test node:
+
----
$ TEST_EXEC_NODES=1 make test-e2e-java
----

=== Race conditions

Test failures during the execution of the integration tests do occur. For example, the following error has been encountered multiple times:
----
Operation cannot be fulfilled on deploymentconfigs.apps.openshift.io "component-app": the object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again
----

The reason this happens is because the _read DeploymentConfig_ or _update DC in memory_ or _call Update_ actions can potentially fail due to the DC being updated concurrently by some other component, usually by Kubernetes or OpenShift itself.

Thus it is recommended to avoid the read, update-in-memory, or push-update actions as much as possible. One remedy is to use the `Patch` operation, for more information see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.11/[`Resource Operations`] section. Another remedy would be to retry the operation when the optimistic concurrency error is encountered.

=== Setting custom Init Container image for bootstrapping Supervisord
For quick deployment of components, odo uses the link:https://github.com/ochinchina/supervisord[Supervisord] process manager.
Supervisord is deployed via link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/nodes/containers/nodes-containers-init.html[Init Container] image. 

`ODO_BOOTSTRAPPER_IMAGE` is an environmental variable which specifies the Init Container image used for Supervisord deployment.  You can modify the value of the variable to use a custom Init Container image.
The default Init Container image is `quay.io/openshiftdo/init` 

. To set a custom Init Container image, run:
+
----
ODO_BOOTSTRAPPER_IMAGE=quay.io/myrepo/myimage:test
----

. To revert back to the default Init Container image, unset the variable:
+
----
unset ODO_BOOTSTRAPPER_IMAGE
----

== Dependency management

`odo` uses `glide` to manage dependencies. `glide` is not strictly required for building `odo` but it is required when managing dependencies under the `vendor/` directory.

If you want to make changes to dependencies please make sure that `glide` is installed and is in your `$PATH`.

=== Installing `glide`

. Download `glide`:
+
----
$ go get -u github.com/Masterminds/glide
----

. Check that `glide` is working
+
----
$ glide --version
----

=== Using glide to add a new dependency

==== Adding a new dependency

. Update the `glide.yaml` file. Add the new package or sub-packages to the `glide.yaml` file. You can add a whole new package as a dependency or just a few sub-packages.
. Run `make vendor-update` to get the new dependencies.
. Commit the updated `glide.yaml`, `glide.lock` and `vendor` files to git.

==== Updating dependencies

. Set new package version in `glide.yaml` file.
. Run `make vendor-update` to update dependencies
. Commit the updated `glide.yaml`, `glide.lock` and `vendor` files to git.

== Release guide

=== Releasing a new version

Making artifacts for a new release is automated within RedHat's internal CI servers. Contact a maintainer for the internal link to release a new version of odo.

To release a new version on GitHub:

**Create a PR that:**

* Updates the version in the following files:

** link:/pkg/version/version.go[`pkg/version/version.go`]
** link:/Dockerfile.rhel[`Dockerfile.rhel`]
** link:/scripts/rpm-prepare.sh[`scripts/rpm-prepare.sh`]

There is a helper script link:../scripts/bump-version.sh[scripts/bump-version.sh] that changes version number in all the files listed above (except `odo.rb`).

. Merge the above PR.
. Once the PR is merged create and push the new git tag for the version.
. Create a new release using the GitHub site (this must be a proper release and NOT a draft).
+

. Update the release description (changelog) on GitHub. To make things easier, a script was created to automatically generate a CHANGELOG and output to `/tmp/changelog`. This script will require a GitHub authentication token which will prompt you when running the script.
+
----
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=yoursupersecretgithubtoken
$ ./scripts/changelog-script.sh ${PREVIOUS_VERSION} ${NEW_VERSION}
----
. Update the Homebrew package:
.. Check commit id for the released tag `git show-ref v0.0.1`
.. Create a PR to update `:tag` and `:revision` in the https://github.com/kadel/homebrew-odo/blob/master/Formula/odo.rb[`odo.rb`] file
in https://github.com/kadel/homebrew-odo[`kadel/homebrew-odo`].
. Create a PR and update the file `build/VERSION` with the  latest version number.

== Writing machine readable output code

Here are some tips to consider when writing machine-readable output code.

- Match similar Kubernetes / OpenShift API structures
- Put as much information as possible within `Spec`
- Use `json:"foobar"` within structs to rename the variables 


Within odo, we unmarshal all information from a struct to json. Within this struct, we use `TypeMeta` and `ObjectMeta` in order to supply meta-data information coming from Kubernetes / OpenShift. 

Below is working example of how we would implement a "HelloWorld" struct.


[source,go]
----
  package main
  
  import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
  
    metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
  )
  
  // Create the struct. Here we use TypeMeta and ObjectMeta
  // as require to create a "Kubernetes-like" API.
  type GenericSuccess struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
    Message           string `json:"message"`
  }
  
  func main() {
  
    // Create the actual struct that we will use
    // you will see that we supply a "Kind" and
    // APIVersion. Name your "Kind" to what you are implementing
    machineOutput := GenericSuccess{
      TypeMeta: metav1.TypeMeta{
        Kind:       "HelloWorldExample",
        APIVersion: "odo.dev/v1alpha1",
      }, 
      ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
        Name: "MyProject",
      }, 
      Message: "Hello API!",
    }
  
    // We then marshal the output and print it out
    printableOutput, _ := json.Marshal(machineOutput)
    fmt.Println(printableOutput)
  }
----

== odo-bot

https://github.com/odo-bot[odo-bot] is the GitHub user that provides automation for certain tasks in `odo`.

It uses the `.travis.yml` script to upload binaries to the GitHub release page using the *deploy-github-release*
personal access token.

== Licenses

`odo` uses link:https://github.com/frapposelli/wwhrd[wwhrd] to  check license compatibility of vendor packages. The configuration for `wwhrd` is stored in link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/master/.wwhrd.yml[`.wwhrd.yml`].

The `whitelist` section is for licenses that are always allowed. The `blacklist` section is for licenses that are never allowed and will always fail a build. Any licenses that are not explicitly mentioned come under the `exceptions` secion and need to be explicitly allowed by adding the import path to the exceptions.

More details about the license compatibility check tool can be found https://github.com/frapposelli/wwhrd[here]
