# Experimental mode in `odo`
---

By default, the features in `odo` which are under development or under experiment are not exposed to the user. The `odo` commands/subcommands/flags associated with these features are hidden in `odo` help as well. 

It is understood that the features in experimental mode (hidden by default) are under development and the behavior of these features is subject to change till the feature is not removed from experimental mode and available for use.

#### Enabling Experimental mode:
Experimental mode can be enabled by:

- Setting an enviroment variable
- Setting odo preference

##### Setting environment variable `ODO_EXPERIMENTAL`:
Experimental mode can be enabled by setting the enviroment variable `ODO_EXPERIMENTAL=true`
```sh
export ODO_EXPERIMENTAL=true
```
##### Setting odo preference:
Experimental mode can be enabled by setting odo preferences as well.
```sh
odo preference set experimental true
```
#### Working with experimental mode:

##### Listing devfile components:
When the experimental mode is enabled, `odo catalog list components` will list the devfile components alongside the OpenShift components.

```
$ odo catalog list components

Odo Devfile Components:
NAME                 DESCRIPTION                           SUPPORTED
java-maven           Upstream Maven and OpenJDK 11         YES

java-openliberty     Open Liberty microservice in Java     YES
java-springboot      Spring Boot® using IBM Java           YES
```

##### Creating a devfile component:
When creating a devfile component with the experimental flag enabled, a local config of the component settings in created at `.odo/env/env.yaml` in the project directory.

```
$ odo create java-spring-boot myspring
Experimental mode is enabled, use at your own risk

Validation
 ✓  Checking Devfile compatibility [234445ns]
 ✓  Validating Devfile [84112ns]

Please use `odo push` command to create the component with source deployed
```

##### Creating and deleting component url:
Create a devfile component url with `odo url create` and delete a devfile component url with `odo url delete`. This updates the component settings at `.odo/env/env.yaml` accordingly.

When creating a component url, the ingress domain must be specified with the flag `--host` and a valid port must be specified with `--port`. The ports to be pushed, must be in the devfile.

```
$ odo url create myspring --port 8080 --host <ingress domain>
 ✓  URL created for component: myspring, cluster host: <ingress domain>

To create URL on the OpenShift Cluster, please use `odo push`
```

When deleting a component url, specify the url name to be deleted
```
$ odo url delete myspring
? Are you sure you want to delete the url myspring Yes
 ✓  URL myspring removed from the env file

To delete URL on the OpenShift Cluster, please use `odo push`
```

To push either of the url sub-command changes, execute `odo push`.

##### Pushing to a devfile component:
When the experimental mode is enabled, `odo push` creates a pod with all the devfile component containers and volumes. Push syncs the local project on disk to the pod container where devfile component has `mountSources: true`. The optional build and the mandatory run commands are executed in order.

```
$ odo push
 •  Push devfile component myspring  ...

Applying URL changes
 ✓  URL myspring: http://myspring.<ingress domain> created
 ✓  Waiting for component to start [65ms]
 ✓  Checking files for pushing [10ms]
 ✓  Syncing files to the component [1s]
 ✓  Executing devbuild command "/artifacts/bin/build-container-full.sh" [1m]
 ✓  Executing devrun command "/artifacts/bin/start-server.sh" [3s]
 ✓  Push devfile component myspring [2m]
 ✓  Changes successfully pushed to component
```

By default, `odo push` executes `devbuild` and `devrun` devfile commands. However, custom commands can be also be provided to `odo push` via flags `--build-command` & `--run-command`. These flags are only available in the experimental mode.

##### Deleting a devfile component:
Delete a devfile component with `odo delete`. This deletes all the Kubernetes resources created during `odo push`. Use the `-all` flag to delete the Kubernetes resources and the local config at `.odo/env/env.yaml`

```
$ odo delete myspring
? Are you sure you want to delete the devfile component? Yes
 ✓  Deleting devfile component myspring [339ms]
 ✓  Successfully deleted component

```
